An android application that reduces manual work for nurses

## The what
In hospital, nurses usually check patient's health status daily, which includes heart rate. The problem is that not all of patients need to use Electrocardiogram (EGC) machine. Therefore, nurses need to manually use handheld sphygmomanometer device to measure patients' heart rates. That process takes time and effort from both nurses and patients, and it's boring.

## The how
- Attach a heart measurement sensor on the patient's arm with an armband. In the scope of this project, we use Polar OH1 sensor

  ***Why Polar OH1***
  
  *Polar provides open API that allows developers to get information of the users*
- Associate the sensor's MAC address to a barcode/image/user
- Make an application that scans the barcode and connect to the sensor associated to that barcode automatically

  ***Why not choose and connect the device that is on the patient arm at the first place?***
  
  *In a hospital, there are many patients. Each of them has his/her own sensor. How does a nurse possibly know which is the right one to connect?*
  
## The detail
\[ TBD \]
